## Development

### Programming/Style Guidelines

1. Never use `--no-verify`.
2. Follow the coding style used in the file.
3. Respect linting rules. We have pre-commit hooks for the job.
4. Code will not be merged if the checks fail.
5. Please tell us over on Discord what you are working on. It helps keep track of project progress.
6. Signing commits isn't necessary, but you can if you want to.

## Testing
Join us over on [Discord](https://discord.gg/rHJ2uqdquK) to help test new features.
Please note, all of this project this is really recent and relatively untested code, so things break sometimes!
So, it really helps to have testers helping diagnose the issue. Heroic is still a small team, and there's only so many things we can do at a time.
