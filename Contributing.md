We're happy to receive contributions anytime!
You can help the project by helping [translate](https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher/wiki/Translations) it, [sponsor](https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher/blob/main/Support.md) it, test new features, or of course, by directly contributing code!

## Development
This section is WIP (probably will link to a seperate article).

## Testing
Join us over on [Discord](https://discord.gg/rHJ2uqdquK) to help test new features.
Please note, all of this project this is really recent and relatively untested code, so things break sometimes!
So, it really helps to have testers helping diagnose the issue. Heroic is still a small team, and there's only so many things we can do at a time.
