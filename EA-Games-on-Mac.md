## IMPORTANT: Running the he EA App with Heroic requires the paid version of Crossover (the free trial can be used, but that's NOT the same as wine-crossover that can be installed with Heroic). Using [Crossover](https://www.codeweavers.com) is the only known working solution.

## You can follow the Linux guide for manual installation options and general troubleshoot
