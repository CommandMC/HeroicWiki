## IMPORTANT: The EA App requires the paid version of Crossover (the free trial can be used, but that's NOT the wine-crossover that can be installed with Heroic). It does NOT work with any other compatibility layer. Using [Crossover](https://www.codeweavers.com) is the only known working solution.

## You can follow the Linux guide for installation options and general troubleshoot
