Here is a glossary of terms you may encounter when using the Heroic Game Launcher.  (Please keep this list in alphabetical order when adding entries.)

# EOS Overlay
Epic Online Services Overlay, the in-game overlay for games from the Epic Games Store.  The EGS counterpart to the Steam Overlay and GOG Galaxy Overlay.

# ESync
Wine eventfd-based synchronization, a wineserver feature to reduce overhead for synchronization objects.  See the Lutris [How To Esync](https://github.com/lutris/docs/blob/master/HowToEsync.md) guide for how to check whether your system supports ESync.

See also FSync.

# FSync

A more performant ESync, but one that requires kernel-level support.  This is available in the mainline Linux kernel from 5.16 onwards[*](https://forums.lutris.net/t/fsync/14179/2).

# [Steam Linux Runtime](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-runtime)
The Steam Linux runtime is a binary linux environment under which native Linux games can be run to avoid having to manually install all the game's dependencies, or to avoid dependency hell for games that are binary-incompatible with the library versions shipped by your distribution.

# [Wine](https://www.winehq.org/)
> Wine (originally an acronym for "Wine Is Not an Emulator") is a compatibility layer capable of running Windows applications on several POSIX-compliant operating systems, such as Linux, macOS, & BSD. Instead of simulating internal Windows logic like a virtual machine or emulator, Wine translates Windows API calls into POSIX calls on-the-fly, eliminating the performance and memory penalties of other methods and allowing you to cleanly integrate Windows applications into your desktop.
