# Gamescope (Linux-specific)

# Gamescope inside of Heroic (specific per game/app)
There is a plan to have a Gamescope setting in Heroic, while that is implemented, you can still use it with Heroic following the steps bellow:
1. Install [Gamescope](https://github.com/Plagman/gamescope) in your system.
2. In Heroic, open the game settings and go to the **Other** tab.
3. On the Advanced Options (Environemnt Variables), put the Gamescope command line you want to use followed by two dashes in the end, for instance: `gamescope -w 1920 -h 1080 -W 3440 -H 1440 -b --`.
4. If you have other variables, make sure you add it add the end of the input like: `DXVK_HUD=full gamescope ... --`
5. For now, enabling `mangohud` or `gamemode` might make gamescope not work, so try with those options enabled first. 

# gamescoped HGK (*all* apps / games started through hgl)
0. Install [Gamescope](https://github.com/Plagman/gamescope) in your system.

## gamescoped HGL - as seperate app
1. edit '~/.local/share/applications/Heroic-Deck.desktop'

* { Hint 1: 'Exec-'line, '/opt/Heroic/heroic' is Debian/Ubuntu-specific, should be streamlined to your distro }
* { Hint 2: 'Exec-'line, for better compatability (f.e. if you want to start other electron-based apps through hgl) you could append '--use-angle=vulkan'}

2. 'Heroic-Deck' should be there as new app, look into ~/.local/share/applications/ to start it manually

## gamescoped hgl as login-session (through sddm, gdm etc., possibly password-free through editing sddm-config)
1. edit '/usr/share/wayland-sessions/Heroic-Deck.desktop'
Exec=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libexec/plasma-dbus-run-session-if-needed kwin_wayland --drm /usr/share/bin/heroicdeck

{ Hint: 'Exec-'line, --drm could be accompanied / replaced by --xwayland --drm --x11-display }

* { Hint 1: 'env'-line, if you want 720p for fps reasons, use '-w 1280 -h 720' (or something else)}
* { Hint 2: 'env'-line, for better compatability (f.e. if you want to start other electron-based apps through hgl) you could append '--use-angle=vulkan'}
* { Hint 3: 'env'-line, '--force-grab-cursor' / --prefer-vk-device needs a relatively new gamescope binary, '--force-grab-cursor' is needed if you 1. use ozone though wayland 2. use antimicrox 3. want to control a hgl-started electron-based-app through antimicrox}

### gamescoped hgl & gamemode (& NICE-capability)
for using gamescope properly with gamemode (and a NICE-capable kernel), just simply 
'sudo setcap 'CAP_SYS_NICE=eip' /usr/games/gamescope'


# what the hell is 'gamescope' anyway?
Gamescope is something only Linux has. 
It is a microcompositor from Valve that is used on the Steam Deck. Its goal is to provide an isolated compositor that is tailored towards gaming and supports many gaming-centric features such as:

1.    Spoofing resolutions.
2.    Upscaling using AMD FidelityFXâ„¢ Super Resolution or NVIDIA Image Scaling.
3.    Limiting framerates.

4.    ProtonGE: bundeled FSR / FSHack is gone? simply use Gamescope.
