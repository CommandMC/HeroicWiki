## Introduction

This page is a continuation of [the environment variables page](Environment-Variables.md) with a specific focus on how to debug games using environment variables. 

## Environment Variables

### WINEDEBUG

When using `WINEDEBUG=+fixme`, follow the below steps to locate the verbose log:

1. See [How to Set Environment Variables](Environment-Variables.md#how-to-convert-steam-environment-variables-to-heroic) to learn how to apply the `WINEDEBUG=+fixme` environment variable. 
2. Launch the game so it produces a new verbose log. After you have launched the game (even if it crashes), close out of it and open the Heroic Games Launcher. 
3. Open the game's page, click `Report a problem running this game`.

4. Either click `SHOW LOG FILE IN FOLDER` or `UPLOAD LOG FILE`, the first will open the directory of the log, the latter will upload the log to a website that you can then share with someone if you are receiving support.
5. Once you have investigated the log, you can remove the environment variable by returning to the `Advanced` tab in the game's settings and clicking the `-` button.

Alternatively, you can open the directory of the log directly, the file paths are listed below:

* Flatpak:
  * `$HOME/.var/app/com.heroicgameslauncher.hgl/config/heroic/GamesConfig`
  * Locate the `-lastPlay` log with the newest timestamp.
* Non-Flatpak (AppImage, DEB, RPM, etc.):
  * `$HOME/.config/heroic/GamesConfig`
  * Locate the `-lastPlay` log with the newest timestamp.

If you have not debugged a log before, typically locating error messages or repeating messages and copying these messages into a search engine of your choice is a good way to begin. If you are still struggling to debug your log, join the [Heroic Games Launcher Discord](https://discord.com/invite/rHJ2uqdquK) and create a support post with your log attached.

### PROTON_LOG

When using `PROTON_LOG=1`, follow the below steps to locate the verbose log:

1. See [How to Set Environment Variables](Environment-Variables.md#how-to-convert-steam-environment-variables-to-heroic) to learn how to apply the `PROTON_LOG=1` environment variable.
2. Launch the game so it produces a new verbose log. After you have launched the game (even if it crashes), close out of it.
3. To locate the log, navigate to one of the file paths below depending on how you installed Heroic.
    * Flatpak:
        * `$HOME/.var/app/com.heroicgameslauncher.hgl`
        * Locate the `steam-#` log with the newest timestamp.
    * Non-Flatpak (AppImage, DEB, RPM, etc.):
        * `$HOME`
        * Locate the `steam-#` log with the newest timestamp.
4. If you are sharing this log with someone providing you support, you may either directly upload the log or upload it to [Pastebin](https://pastebin.com/) or a website of a your choice.
5. Once you have investigated the log, you can remove the environment variable by returning to the `Advanced` tab in the game's settings and clicking the `-` button.
