## EA Games through Epic Games 

Some Electronic Arts games require the EA App ([link](https://www.ea.com/ea-app)). The description page for these games will contain "Third-Party Manager EA app". When installing EA games from Epic, Heroic will automatically install and manage the EA application.

At this time, Heroic will only manage the EA application for EA games bought from the Epic store. If you have an EA game bought directly from EA, you may follow the steps on this page to sideload the EA application.
