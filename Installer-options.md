I was doing some testing in Heroic Launcher, and was trying to set up an installation of a game that was not in GOG or any of the other supported store. 

This game is Rance 01 for PC, but it has a .msi installer, however I can't run the installer seperately and choose the path it should be installed to before then selecting the executable to run the game. 
The executable doesn't exist yet, so I can't selec it as of yet, and selectin "Run Installer First" would not bring up the pop up in "Add Game" 

I did test this in Lutris, and one option it has when adding a game is install first then you tell it where the install will go and it sets up more accordingly and auto selects the executable after installation, this may be a good idea for a future update of Heroic Launcher.
