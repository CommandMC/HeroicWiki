## Running the game on MacOS

This game can only be run using [Crossover](https://www.codeweavers.com). Note that it is the paid version of Crossover, it is NOT the `wine-crossover` that can be installed with Heroic.

The game won't run with neither Whisky nor GPTK.

You can use the free trial of Crossover to make sure it works before buying it.
