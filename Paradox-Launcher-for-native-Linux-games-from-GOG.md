The Paradox Launcher will fail to launch with the following error for native Linux versions of Paradox Interactive games from GOG if Heroic is running in a flatpak:

    Could not locate a valid installation of the Paradox Launcher:
    open /home/$USER/.var/app/com.heroicgameslauncher.hgl/data/Paradox Interactive/launcherpath: no such file or directory

To resolve, a simple symlink can be created with the following command:

`ln -s /home/$USER/.var/app/com.heroicgameslauncher.hgl/.local/share/Paradox\ Interactive /home/$USER/.var/app/com.heroicgameslauncher.hgl/data/Paradox\ Interactive`

> This only needs to be done once, even if you have multiple games with the Paradox Launcher experiencing this problem.

> Paradox staff are aware of the issue. The issue is likely to be properly fixed in a future update of the Paradox Launcher.
