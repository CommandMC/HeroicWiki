## Usage

It is intended to install and configure games from desktop mode only. Running Heroic itself through Game Mode is not supported and you may encounter issues doing so. 

The proper way to use Heroic with the Steam Deck is to open Heroic in desktop mode, install and update games from there. You may need to play games at least once in desk top mode to confirm that they are functioning properly and in the case where a game requires user interaction on first launch, such as associating your Epic account with the game via a web browser pop up.

Once a game is installed, you can add it to steam through the 3 dot menu on the game page, or by selecting "auto add to steam" from the heroic settings on the side bar.

## How to Install Heroic Games Launcher

### Flatpak (Recommended)

To install Heroic Games Launcher using the Flatpak, follow the below steps. The Flatpak is the recommended packaging method to use Heroic Games Launcher on the Steam Deck. 

1. Switch to **Desktop mode**.
2. Open the app store (Discover).
3. Search for "Heroic".
4. There should be a result for Heroic Games Launcher. Click install.
5. You should now be able to launch Heroic like any other application on your Steam Deck!

#### Flatpak Permissions

Purpose: Give permissions to SD Card, other partitions, external drives, etc.

Flatpak's containerization while intended for increased security does limit Heroic's permissions to several system's features and folders. It is necessary to give extra permissions to Heroic. 

**If you are using KDE (includes the Steam Deck):**

1. Open the `System Settings`
2. On the left-hand side, click `Applications` under the `Personalization` section
3. On the left-hand side, click `Flatpak Permission Settings`
4. In the list of applications, locate Heroic Games Launcher and click it to open the permissions menu.
5. On the right-hand side under the `Permissions` menu, locate the `Filesystem Access` section.
6. Click `Add New` and add your preferred path.
7. When finished, set it to `read/write` and click `OK`
8. Restart Heroic Games Launcher.

**If you are not using KDE:**

In this case we will need to install Flatseal from the Discover or another Linux Store that you use.

1. Search for and install Flatseal on your Store, Discover on Steam Deck.

### AppImage

To install Heroic Games Launcher using the AppImage, follow the below steps. 

1. Switch to Desktop Mode.

   * Depending on when you are reading this page, the version # may differ
   * If you do not see the AppImage, click `Show all ## assets`

6. Double click the AppImage to open Heroic.

#### Game Mode

Though it is not recommended to use Heroic in Game Mode, you may add the AppImage to Game Mode by following the below steps.

## HDR

### Flatpak

The Heroic Flatpak requires the Gamescope Flatpak to enable HDR. However, the Flatpak Gamescope version must match the version of the natively installed Gamescope. As of October 29th, 2024, the Steam Deck Gamescope is on version `3.15.13-2`. The natively installed Gamescope is close enough to the latest version of the Flatpak meaning the only step required to enable HDR is to install the Flatpak Gamescope. This section will also cover how to identify the currently installed Gamescope version. 

To enable HDR with the Flatpak version of Heroic, follow the below steps.

1. Switch to Desktop Mode.
2. Open Konsole.
3. The following command will set a sudo password. If this is your first time setting a sudo password, make sure it is secure and that you **do not** forget it. if you have already set a sudo password, skip to Step 4.
    * `passwd`
    * Konsole will prompt you to create a password, any characters typed here will not display in the terminal. Once you have typed a password, press enter and Konsole will ask you to type it again to confirm. 
    * If the commands after this step request a sudo password, type the password you created here for the respective step. 
4. Type the following command and press enter:
    * `gamescope --version`
    *  As of October 29th, 2024, the Gamescope version currently installed should be `3.15.13-2`, note this down for the next step.  
5. Type the following command and press enter: 
    * `flatpak install org.freedesktop.Platform.VulkanLayer.gamescope --system -y`
    * If you see a list of Gamescope versions, select the version closest to the version you located in Step 4. For example, as of October 29th, the Gamescope version currently installed should be `3.15.13-2`. Currently, the closest Flatpak version in the list should be `24.08`. Locate `runtime/org.freedesktop.Platform.VulkanLayer.gamescope/x86_64/24.08` in the list and confirm your selection by typing the respective number. For example, if it is the third item in the list, type `3` and press enter. 
6. The Flatpak Gamescope will now be installed and HDR will now work in Game Mode.

**Optional: Freezing Updates**

If the Gamescope Flatpak updates and is no longer in sync with the natively installed Gamescope, HDR may stop working. As an optional step, you may mask the Gamescope Flatpak in order to "freeze" its updates.

1. Switch to Desktop Mode.
2. Open Konsole
3. Type the following command and press enter: 
    * `sudo flatpak mask org.freedesktop.Platform.VulkanLayer.gamescope`
4. The Gamescope Flatpak will now be masked and its updates will be "frozen". 

To unmask the Gamescope Flatpak, use the following command:

`sudo flatpak --remove mask org.freedesktop.Platform.VulkanLayer.gamescope`

### AppImage

HDR will work out of the box with the AppImage.

## Common Issues

### Mangohud does not work

Check if you have installed the Flatpak version of Mangodhud: `flatpak install org.freedesktop.Platform.VulkanLayer.MangoHud`

### Gamescope not available

Check if you have installed the Flatpak version of Gamescope: `flatpak install org.freedesktop.Platform.VulkanLayer.gamescope`

If you are on a Steam Deck, the Flatpak version of Gamescope must match the natively installed version. If these versions do not match, you may experience increased crashing in other Flatpaks.
