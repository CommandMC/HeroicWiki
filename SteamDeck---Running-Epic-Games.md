### Install with flatpak (recommended):
1) Go to **Desktop mode**
2) Open the app store (discover)
3) Search for "Heroic"
4) There should be a result for Heroic games launcher, click install
5) You should now be able to launch Heroic like any other application on your steam deck

If you wish to, you can also make use of a tool called **Heroic Bash Launcher** to launch games directly by [following this guide](https://github.com/redromnon/HeroicBashLauncher/wiki/Steam-Deck-(Flatpak)-Guide).
