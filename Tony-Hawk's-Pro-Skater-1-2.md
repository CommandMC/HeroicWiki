5. The save path will be wrong by default, it will be:
```
/home/deck/Games/Heroic/Prefixes/TonyHawksProSkater/drive_c/users/steamuser/AppData/Local/VicariousVisions/
```
it should be
```
/home/deck/Games/Heroic/Prefixes/TonyHawksProSkater/drive_c/users/steamuser/AppData/Local/VicariousVisions/THPS/Saved/SaveGames
```
6. Play the game!
