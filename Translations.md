Heroic is currently available in several languages listed in the [README.](https://github.com/flavioislima/HeroicGamesLauncher/blob/main/README.md)
You can help us by adding to this list!

## How to add a new translation?

Right now we are using Weblate to manage all translations so if you want to add or fix translations, you will need to open an account there, translate all three main components: Global, Login, and GamePage and then commit your changes.
There are a few rules If you want to translate it:
1. For new Languages, only a 100% coverage will be accepted.
2. Languages with less than 90% coverage will be removed from Heroic while the translation its not updated until 100% again.
